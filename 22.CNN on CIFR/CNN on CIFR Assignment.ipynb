You need to create a copy of this and \"retrain\" this model to achieve 90+ test accuracy. \n","3.  You cannot use DropOut layers.\n","4.  You MUST use Image Augmentation Techniques.\n","5.  You cannot use an already trained model as a beginning points, you have to initilize as your own\n","6.  You cannot run the program for more than 300 Epochs, and it should be clear from your log, that you have only used 300 Epochs\n","7.  You cannot use test images for training the model.\n","8.  You cannot change the general architecture of DenseNet (which means you must use Dense Block, Transition and Output blocks as mentioned in the code)\n","9.

You can checkpoint your model and retrain the model from that checkpoint so that no need of training the model from first if you lost at any epoch while training. You can directly load that model and Train from that epoch. "]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"TLVcyNYKflQi"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
